# arch_env
My arch linux environment

- Copy the `dot_files` folder into your home directory.
- The `script` folder contains various helpers:
	- bluetooth - contains bluetooth-related helpers
		- reconnect.sh - is used to reconnect bluetooth devices (ex - the bridge bluetooth keyboard). After a reboot to windows
		some devices can "get confused" and must be re-paired with linux.
